# Music_Prediction_Program_Using_Python
This is an ML based project with Python.

Typical ML Project steps includes:
1. Import the Data
2. Cleaning of Data
3. Split of Data into Training and Test Set
4. Creating a model
5. Train model
6. Make Predictions/Testing
7. Evaluate and Improve

# Requirements
1. You need python offcourse
2. Pandas library which can be simply installed with 
    ```pip install pandas```
3. Sklearn library which can be installed with ```pip install -U scikit-learn```

# Working
1. Random dataset has been created with different data of the people who likes different music
genres.
2. Data is then trained on the model DecisionTreeClassifier which is provided by python inside the
scikit-learn library.
3. After data is trained evaluations are done using scikit-learn builtin module/class accuracy_score
